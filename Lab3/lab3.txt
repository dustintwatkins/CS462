1. What parsing method did you choose?

2. Did you accomplish step 5 with an event expression or a rule conditional? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the method you used instead of the other?

3. What was the output of the testing your ruleset before the find_high_temps rule was added? How many directives were returned? How many rules do you think ran?

4. What was the output of the test after the find_high_temps rule was added? How many directives were returned? How many rules do you think ran?

5. How do you account for the difference? Diagram the event flow within the pico (i.e. show the event flow from when the pico receives the first event to the directives being created) using a swimlane diagram (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

6. Would you say that your find_high_temps rule is an event intermediary? If so, what kind? Justify your answer.

7. How do your logs show that the find_high_temps rule works? Pick out specific lines and explain them.

Questions:
1. Explain how the rule collect_temperatures and the temperatures function work as an event-query API.
	The rule and function work as an event-query API because when a wovyn : new_temperature_reading has been raised, we store a temperature and the time it was recorded. It behaves just like an event-query API.

2. Explain your strategy for finding temperatures that are in range.
	I used the convenient set operations that KRL has. I used difference(). If you have 2 lists A and B. You can use A.difference(B) and it will return all values in A that are not in list B. So for finding temperatures in range, I take the list of all temperatures and find the difference between all temperatures that are stored in the threshold violations list.

3. What happens if provides doesn't list the name of the temperatures function?
	provides declares thes values in the temperature_store ruleset that will be provided when used as a module. They would not be made available without provides.

4. What happens if shares doesn't list it?
	shares makes a list of names that are available to sky/cloud queries. So if shares doesn't list temperatures, temperatures is not available to sky/cloud queries.

Create a new channel (pick any name and type you like). 
	Send an event to the pico using the new channel and the original (default) channel. 
   		Do you get the same result on both? Why or why not? 
		Got different txn_id
			For new channel: "txn_id": "cjqy46fu8000n93vrfkpx83ql"
			For default channel: "txn_id": "cjqy46xw3000o93vrf841d92d"

		Delete the channel.
			Resend the event using the deleted channel. 
			What happens? Why?
				I got an error: "error": "ECI not found: M9w1dBhNe4n9u4XCCj1TpA"
				The reason is because the channel does not exist

		
Send the misspelled event ecco/hello to your pico. 
	What do you observe? Why?
		"directives": [] 
		Because there are no directives spelled ecco, we have one spelt echo

Add a new rule to the hello_world ruleset that selects on echo/monkey and responds with
"Hello Monkey" unless an event attribute named name is given, in which case it will respond with 
"Hello " followed by the given name. Hint: use the .defaultsTo() operator. Use the .klog() operator to log the value that is used.

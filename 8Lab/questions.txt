Can a sensor be in more than one collection based on the code you wrote? Why or why not? What are the implications of a sensor being in more than one collection? 
How could you ensure that only certain picos can raise an event that causes a temperature report to be generated? 
How do the debug logs show that your scatter-gather system worked?
How can you know a report is done and all the sensors that are going to respond have reported? 
Given your answer above, how would you recover if the number of responding sensors is less than the total number of sensors?
